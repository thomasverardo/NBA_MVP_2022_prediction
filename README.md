# NBA_MVP_2022_prediction__
Machine Learning project

A dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games) contains information about NBA games from several recent seasons (from 2004 on), at the level of the single player contribution to each game.

Different learning problems can be settled with this dataset. Some problem examples are:

 - predicting the outcome of a season
 - predicting the outcome of a match
 - predicting some statistics of a player in a match
 - predicting the most impactful player of a match
 - grouping matches or players according to some interesting criterion

Focus on (at least) one specific problem and present a thorough and solid analysis (visualization tools are welcome both in exploration and communication of your results and reflections). 

Note that the problems in the short list above are just a suggestion and are described very briefly: the student is required to consider a problem (that has to be sound!) and to exactly define it.

##Integration

We also integrate this dataset with others using nba_api (https://github.com/swar/nba_api).
