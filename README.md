# NBA MVP 2021 prediction
Machine Learning project

The goal of our project is to predict who will be the MVP of 2021 using information on players and matches of the entire regular season.
The MVP is elected by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, thus our aim is to predict the best performing player according to their preferences and thus to understand which features are the most valued.

With the same model we can predict all MVP, but only if the regular season is finished

A dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games) contains information about NBA games from several recent seasons (from 2004 on), at the level of the single player contribution to each game.

##Integration

We also integrate this dataset with others using nba_api (https://github.com/swar/nba_api).
